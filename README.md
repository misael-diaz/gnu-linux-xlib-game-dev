# GNU/Linux Xlib Game Dev
Game development with xlib for GNU/Linux.

## Motivation

My drive is not to build a game because I like games but to build a game because I
want to get the experience of writing code in an area outside of my field of expertise.

## References

We are using the [Xlib Programming Manual](https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/) as our main
source of information for building this game and of course the GNU/Linux man pages.

## Progress
